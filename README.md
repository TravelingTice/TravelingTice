## Hi! I'm TravelingTice. Also known as Matthijs Kralt. Nice to meet you!

I'm a web developer who loves travel. Started out making websites for friends! I'm working as a part-time software developer at [WebinarGeek](https://webinargeek.com).

On the side, I also make my own projects. Usually ones that combine my passion for travel with my skills in coding.

[Map My Tours](https://mapmytours.app) is the app I currently work on the most. It's a cool tool that lets you make interactive maps of your trips and travels!
